Next run the first.py, later we need to train the datasets. So, we run the trainer.py code to train the datasets.
   
Finally we run the facialrec.py file to run our facial recognition code.
   
In the facial recognition code,
  
  we can change the users name in line 23, 24 of the program according to the id we entered in the execution of first.py code.  
 
 We can add more users by typing in:

        if(Id== ID_No.):
            Id="NAME OF THE PERSON"
   
   where, ID_No. is the respective Id number we gave in the execution of first.py code.
